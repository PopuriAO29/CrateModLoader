1.4.0

General
- PS1, PS2, PSP and Folder mode extraction step is now multithreaded
- Modding step is now multithreaded
- Preloading is now multithreaded and combined with the main process (no longer needs to extract again after clicking Start)
- Every randomizer is now handled independently from each other 
(Before - Seed of randomizer feature 1 affects seed of randomizer feature 2; 
 After - The same seed has the same result for feature 2 regardless of whether feature 1 is enabled)
- More detailed process information
- Every game (supported or otherwise) can now be preloaded 
- More Mod Crate management options:  Change install order, Delete, Import, Create, Edit
- You can now create and edit full-fledged Mod Crates from within the program. (The game must be preloaded to create or edit Mod Crates)
- Fixed not being able to build unsupported games
- Blocked starting a new process after one finishes to prevent bugs. To work around this you can (re)open a ROM or fully restart the program.
- Mod Crates can now also include Octodiff-based delta patches for every game file (ex. /layer1/Language/Code/English.txt.octodelta)
They can be automatically created from within the Crate Mod Loader, or manually using Octodiff's 1.2.1 version.
The advantage to using them is a lower file size of Mod Crates, the downside being incompatibility between different versions of the same game file.
