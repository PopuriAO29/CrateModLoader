`Crash.Audio.SampleLine::ToPCM` and `Crash.Audio.ADPCMConv` are based
directly off of some code from nextvolume's psxsdk (vag2wav.c), which claims
it's "Based on VAG-Depack 0.1 by bITmASTER".

This program is sometimes packaged with OpenTK, in which case the license for OpenTK will be included in a separate file.

Aside from that, whatever.
